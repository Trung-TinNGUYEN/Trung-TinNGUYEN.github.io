The program includes talks on statistical methods for mixture models, both from a theoretical and a practical point of view, so that the conference should gather specialists from the different communities. The participation of junior researchers as well as PhD students is particularly encouraged. This workshop is organized under the project [**SMILES**](https://smiles.lmno.cnrs.fr/index.html) (Statistical Modeling and Inference for unsupervised Learning at LargE-Scale) funded by the french National Research Agency (ANR). It is also connected to the ex-RIN project [**AStERiCS**](https://asterics.lmno.cnrs.fr/index.html) (Scaled Statistical Learning for Representation and Unsupervised Classification), which was funded by the region Normandy, and the final culmination of which MiMo2020 (cancelled due to Covid-19 crisis) should have been.

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


Slides can be added in a few ways:

- **Create** slides using Academic&#39;s [*Slides*](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/managing-content/#create-slides) feature and link using `slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
- **Upload** an existing slide deck to `static/` and link using `url_slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
- **Embed** your slides (e.g. Google Slides) or presentation video on this page using [shortcodes](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/writing-markdown-latex/).

Further talk details can easily be added to this page using *Markdown* and $\rm \LaTeX$ math code.

Machine learning is changing the world we live in at a break neck pace. From image recognition and generation, to the deployment of recommender systems, it seems to be breaking new ground constantly and influencing almost every aspect of our lives. In ths seminar series we ask distinguished speakers to comment on what role Bayesian statistics and Bayesian machine learning have in this rapidly changing landscape. Do we need to optimally process information or borrow strength in the big data era? Are philosophical concepts such as coherence and the likelihood principle relevant when you are running a large scale recommender system? Are variational approximations, MCMC or EP appropriate in a production environment? Can I use the propensity score and call myself a Bayesian? How can I elicit a prior over a massive dataset? Is Bayes a reasonable theory of how to be perfect but a hopeless theory of how to be good? Do we need Bayes when we can just A/B test? What combinations of pragmatism and idealism can be used to deploy Bayesian machine learning in a large scale live system? We ask Bayesian believers, Bayesian pragmatists and Bayesian sceptics to comment on all of these subjects and more.

      <title>Non-asymptotic penalization criteria for model selection in mixture of experts models</title>

The program includes talks on statistical methods for mixture models, both from a theoretical and a practical point of view, so that the conference should gather specialists from the different communities. The participation of junior researchers as well as PhD students is particularly encouraged. This workshop is organized under the project [**SMILES**](https://smiles.lmno.cnrs.fr/index.html) (Statistical Modeling and Inference for unsupervised Learning at LargE-Scale) funded by the french National Research Agency (ANR). It is also connected to the ex-RIN project [**AStERiCS**](https://asterics.lmno.cnrs.fr/index.html) (Scaled Statistical Learning for Representation and Unsupervised Classification), which was funded by the region Normandy, and the final culmination of which MiMo2020 (cancelled due to Covid-19 crisis) should have been.

      <title>Approximate Bayesian computation with surrogate posteriors</title>

Machine learning is changing the world we live in at a break neck pace. From image recognition and generation, to the deployment of recommender systems, it seems to be breaking new ground constantly and influencing almost every aspect of our lives. In ths seminar series we ask distinguished speakers to comment on what role Bayesian statistics and Bayesian machine learning have in this rapidly changing landscape. Do we need to optimally process information or borrow strength in the big data era? Are philosophical concepts such as coherence and the likelihood principle relevant when you are running a large scale recommender system? Are variational approximations, MCMC or EP appropriate in a production environment? Can I use the propensity score and call myself a Bayesian? How can I elicit a prior over a massive dataset? Is Bayes a reasonable theory of how to be perfect but a hopeless theory of how to be good? Do we need Bayes when we can just A/B test? What combinations of pragmatism and idealism can be used to deploy Bayesian machine learning in a large scale live system? We ask Bayesian believers, Bayesian pragmatists and Bayesian sceptics to comment on all of these subjects and more.
